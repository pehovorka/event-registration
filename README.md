Assignment for module CSCU9YW – Web services at the University of Stirling. Created using Spring Boot on the server & React on the client side.

*Important things to note: It may take up to 30 seconds for the demonstration server to start up – you may need to refresh the page on the first visit to see the data and the API docs. The database is not persistent and gets cleared after the server instance is shut down.*
